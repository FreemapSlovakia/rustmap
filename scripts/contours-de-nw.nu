# Generate contour lines for Nordrhein-Westfalen from the 2 m smoothed DEM tiles
# that shading-de-nw.nu emitted along the way. Port of contours-de-by.nu.
#
# Pipeline: /mnt/osm/de-nw/smooth2m/*.tif  (1250x1250 px windows, 2 m, EPSG:25832)
#             -> one state VRT
#             -> consolidate to ONE contiguous raster on the 18TB
#             -> gdal_contour -> GPKG (EPSG:25832)
#
# THE CONTOURS MUST COME FROM THE SMOOTHED DEM. Contouring raw 1 m LiDAR gives
#   unusable spaghetti — every furrow and forest-floor speckle becomes a closed
#   loop. That is why the shading run bothers to emit smooth2m/ rather than
#   letting this script downsample the source itself. If smooth2m is empty, run
#   shading-de-nw.nu first; do NOT point this at the DGM1 tiles as a shortcut.
#   (Luxembourg measured the difference: 46103 features unsmoothed against 30995
#   smoothed over identical terrain — a third of the lines were noise.)
#
# The consolidation pass is NOT skipped. gdal_contour over a many-thousand-tile
#   VRT is pathologically slow — scattered reads, tiles reopened per scanline —
#   so the tiles are merged into one contiguous raster first.
#
# NO DATUM HAZARD. EPSG:25832 is ETRS89 / UTM 32N, so the path to WGS 84 is a
#   null transform — nothing to install, nothing for PROJ to get silently wrong.
#   Contrast England (OSGB36, needs OSTN15) and Flanders (BD72, needs the IGN
#   NTv2 grid). This GPKG is native 25832 regardless.
#
# EDGE TRIANGULATION AT THE STATE BORDER. Bayern's DGM1 was measured to be
#   TIN-interpolated in the outer ~50 m of coverage (roughness 0.0142 m against
#   0.0273 m inland), and the same is assumed here rather than re-measured.
#   Expect slightly too-smooth, too-straight lines within ~300 m of the NRW
#   boundary. A cutline at the administrative border would remove it; not
#   applied yet.
#
# ELEVATION RANGE. NRW spans roughly 10 m (Lower Rhine at the Dutch border) to
#   843 m (Langenberg, Rothaargebirge), so at a 10 m interval expect ~85 levels
#   — a third of Bayern's ~290, and closer to Belgium's 83.
#
#   THAT MATTERS FOR MEMORY: the offset-pass machinery below exists because
#   Bayern's 290 levels over 33 Gpx got the single-pass run OOM-killed at 41 GB.
#   NRW is both flatter and half the size (~15 Gpx), i.e. comfortably inside
#   what Belgium did in one pass. The passes are kept anyway — they cost only
#   wall-clock, the union is identical, and guessing wrong costs an hour.
#
# Output: <18TB>/de-nw/nrw_contours.gpkg (layer `cont_de_nw_dtm`, EPSG:25832).

# ── HANDOFF TO POSTGIS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# 1. LOAD IT. The splitter now creates the destination table in its final
#    serving shape (height_m smallint, wkb_geometry geometry(LineString,3857))
#    and builds the GiST index itself when the load finishes. The old dance —
#    hand-CREATE a wide table, then DROP ogc_fid, DROP id, cast height to
#    smallint, rename to height_m, rename the table, CREATE INDEX — is gone,
#    along with the chances to forget a step between countries.

#
#    NOTE: `--simplify-high-quality` and `--drop-existing` are boolean FLAGS —
#    passing either a value fails with "unexpected argument".
#
#    smallint holds NRW's range with room to spare (max 843 m). The index is
#    named contours_de_nw_wkb_geometry_geom_idx, matching en/hr/no/se/lu/sk/be.

# 2. pg_restore ONTO fm5 NEEDS --no-tablespaces (the dump carries this box's
