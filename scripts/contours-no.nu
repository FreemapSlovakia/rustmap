# Generate contour lines for all of Norway from the 2 m smoothed DEM tiles that
# shading-no.nu emitted along the way.
# Norway port of contours-hr.nu (Croatia 1 m) / contours-pl.nu (Poland 1 m).
#
# Pipeline: /mnt/osm/no/smooth2m/*.tif   (48101 tiles, 1500x1500 px, 2 m, EPSG:25833)
#             -> one national VRT
#             -> consolidate to ONE contiguous raster on the 18TB
#             -> gdal_contour -> GPKG (EPSG:25833)
#
# TWO DIFFERENCES FROM contours-hr.nu, both because shading-no.nu did the work up front:
#
#  * NO per-tile cropped VRTs. The Croatian script had to strip a 6 px overlap
#    from every smooth/ tile with its own gdal_translate -srcwin, 62351 of them.
#    shading-no.nu's dem2m step already wrote each window cropped to its exact
#    3 km extent (-projwin at the window bounds, collar excluded), so these tiles
#    tile the plane seamlessly with no overlap and no gaps. gdalbuildvrt is enough.
#
#  * NO 1 m -> 2 m downsampling. The tiles are already 2 m, produced with
#    nodata-aware `average` from the smoothed 1 m DEM while it was still in RAM.
#    That is the expensive half of Croatia's consolidation pass (8.5 h there;
#    it would have been ~45 h over Norway's area) already paid.
#
#    NOTE: the consolidation itself is NOT skipped — earlier notes of mine said
#    so and that was wrong. gdal_contour over a 48k-tile VRT is pathologically
#    slow (scattered reads, tiles reopened per scanline), exactly as the Croatian
#    header describes, so the tiles still have to be merged into one contiguous
#    raster first. What changed is that this pass now only copies 2 m data
#    instead of reading ~900 GB of 1 m data and resampling it.
#
# Consolidated DEM goes on the 18TB, not the NVMe: at Norway's bbox it is a few
# hundred GB and /mnt/osm has ~485 GB free with smooth2m already occupying 186 GB.
# gdal_contour reads it sequentially, so spinning rust costs little.
#
# nodata is clean: -9999 on every tile, presented unchanged by the VRT. Genuine
# 0.00 m coastal contours are preserved because out-of-coverage is -9999, never 0.
#
# Output: /mnt/osm/no/norway_contours.gpkg (layer `cont_no_dmr`, EPSG:25833).
# Handoff to the splitter (split <=1000 pts, simplify, stream into PostGIS):

#
# NOTE: `--simplify-high-quality` is a boolean FLAG — passing it a value fails with
# "unexpected argument". Omit it for fast Douglas-Peucker; pass it bare for Visvalingam.
#
# Resumable: the VRT, consolidated raster and GPKG are each skipped if present
# (delete to force a rebuild). Run via:
